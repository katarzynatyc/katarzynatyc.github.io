`MS Bioinformatics Student`

I am currently an accelerated masterâ€™s student studying bioinformatics at VCU. What excites me most about the bioinformatics field is being able to apply data science practices to discover patterns that can ultimately be used to improve a patient's health. Through this project I hope to gain more advanced knowledge of whole genome sequencing, particularly the role of reference genomes in developing specialized medical treatments.
