`Computational Biology & Cancer Genomics`

We study how genetic diversity shapes cancer — and how our one-size-fits-all reference genome falls short. Our work uses pangenome graphs and patient-derived data to uncover ancestry-specific cancer biomarkers and reduce disparities in precision medicine.

And with our recent cMEDA Seed Grant, we’re expanding into spatial transcriptomics to explore how the microbiome interacts with its host — bringing my scientific journey full circle. :arrows_counterclockwise: :dart:
