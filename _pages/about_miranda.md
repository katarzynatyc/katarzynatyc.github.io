`MS Summer Research Internship`

I am currently pursuing a Master's in Biostatistics at Virginia Commonwealth University, building on my foundation in Biology and Chemistry from FSU. My early research focused on virology and microbiology along with homologous genes in  Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), sparking a deep interest in host-microbe interactions. Now, I'm excited to apply that interest to the data analytics side of research by learning about bioinformatics and spatial transcriptomics. As part of this lab, I'm looking at how bacterial presence spatially influences RNA expression in epithelial cells. This summer research is my first hands-on experience with Visium technology, spatial data analysis in R, and large genomic datasets which I'm eager to learn and develop. I hope to use this experience to prepare for a future industry where I can contribute research in my areas of interest: 
Spatial Transcriptomics
Cancer Biology / Clinical Trials
Microbiology Analysis
Environmental Spatial Analysis 

Outside of my studies, I enjoy dancing, hiking, travelings, and reading a good fantasy or sci-fi novel.
