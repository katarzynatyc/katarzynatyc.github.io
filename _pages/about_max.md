`MS Bioinformatics Student`

My personal interests of science fiction, history, and all things nature, led me to pursue a BA in Geography, and while spending over two years with the U.S. Geological Survey, I earned a BSc in Bioinformatics from VCU. Now pursuing an MSc in Bioinformatics, I use an interdisciplinary background to combine geospatial remote-sensing knowledge with spatial transcriptomics.
