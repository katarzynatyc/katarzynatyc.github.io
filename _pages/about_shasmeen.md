`VCU Honors College MS Bioinformatics Student`

I am passionate about using bioinformatics to create more precise and effective medicines to help personalize clinical procedures and improve outcomes. From this research experience, I hope to get better proficiency with both common and uncommon bioinformatics tools and experience with large-scale genomic workflows. Itâ€™s also a wonderful opportunity to work with others in this field and grow my perspective!
