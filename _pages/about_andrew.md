I am a second-year Bioinformatics Masterâ€™s student at Virginia Commonwealth University with a focus on spatial transcriptomics. My research explores the tumor microenvironment in human breast cancer using Visium HD data and R-based analysis pipelines. I hope to apply the computer science and clinical research experience I've gained and look forward to becoming proficient in R-based analytic pipelines. I'm excited to learn about the tricks and nuances of the analyses as a new member in the bioinformatics scene.
