`VCU Honors College BSc Bioinformatics Student`

I am an undergraduate student at Virginia Commonwealth University, pursuing a B.S. in Bioinformatics, on the Pre-Medicine pathway. I believe that science and medicine go hand in handâ€”global crises can only be tackled through effective collaboration between researchers and healthcare professionals. Fueled by my personal experiences, I am interested in how the computational aspects of bioinformatics can be used for biomedical research as well as clinical applications. Specifically, I hope to investigate the genetic and molecular mechanisms of diseases such as cancer. As both an aspiring physician and scientist, I aim to merge my passions for medicine and research, to address global healthcare disparities, and advocate for underserved communities.
