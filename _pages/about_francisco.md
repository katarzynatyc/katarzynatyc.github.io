`MS Bioinformatics Student`

I graduated as a Medical Laboratory Scientist and spent my first three years working in UVA’s Flow Cytometry Department, where I assisted in diagnosing hematological malignancies. This experience sparked my interest in the computational tools used for biomarker analysis, which inspired me to pursue my Master’s in Bioinformatics.
